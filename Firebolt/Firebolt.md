
## Project Description: 
   
Mental health has largely been an ignored sector in Health Industry. People silently suffer with stress related issues due to the stigma associated with mental illnesses. Shortage and inaccessibility of  Mental Health professionals, is an added blunder. So, to provide a permanent solution to this ubiquitous problem we switch to ancient technique of breathing. Using technology we aim to correct the breathing pattern of users, which will in turn enable their body to fight off the disabilities itself. Our user interface plans to train users to breathe properly and come out of the incorrect breathing loop.
